##Introduction
Numderiv implements classic finite-difference numerical differentiation for the calculation of first, second, or third order derivatives on a slice of data. Functions for both first-order and second-order approximations are provided.

A future update to this package will provide numerical differentiation via spline fitting (helpful when dealing with irregular time series).
