##Introduction
Numderiv implements classic finite-difference numerical differentiation for the calculation of first, second, or third order derivatives on a slice of data (usually a time-series). Functions for both first-order and second-order approximations are provided. Currently only backwards-looking derivatives are supported, with plans to add centered and forward-looking derivatives in the near-future.

A future update to this package will provide numerical differentiation via spline fitting (helpful when dealing with irregular time series) and integration with CUDA/OpenCL.
